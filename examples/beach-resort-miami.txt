Absolutely loved our family vacation at the Oceanview Beach Resort in Miami! 
The kids had a blast at the pool and the beach access was perfect. 
Our room had an amazing ocean view and was very spacious for our family of four.
The staff went above and beyond to make our stay special, especially the concierge who 
helped us book all our excursions. The only minor complaint was that the restaurant 
prices were a bit steep, but the food quality made up for it. Would definitely return! 5 stars.
