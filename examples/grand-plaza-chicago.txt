I stayed at the Grand Plaza Hotel in downtown Chicago for 3 nights. 
The location was perfect - right next to the metro and shopping district.
The room was spotlessly clean and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.
However, I found it quite pricey for what you get. The breakfast was disappointing 
and the WiFi kept dropping. Overall it was a decent stay but I expected more 
for the price point. I'd give it 3.5 stars.
