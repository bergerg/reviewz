  "review": "I had such high hopes for the Downtown Boutique Hotel but what a letdown. The room hadn't been properly cleaned - found hair in the bathroom and dust everywhere. The air conditioning was broken and it was sweltering hot. We complained to the front desk but they were incredibly rude and unhelpful. The walls were paper thin so we could hear every conversation from neighboring rooms. Breakfast was stale and limited options. To top it off, they charged us for parking that was supposed to be included. Completely overpriced for what you get. Really regret booking here.",
